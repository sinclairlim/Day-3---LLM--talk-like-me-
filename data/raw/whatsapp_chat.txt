Some wants “Rolls Royce” treatment others ok with “Nissan” …
[26/9/19, 1:47:59 AM] Mom: Usually school would request for a min cover.
[26/9/19, 1:47:59 AM] Mom: Also, most schools recommend but do not make it a compulsory as long as you can provide a med policy to meet or fulfil an equivalent…
[26/9/19, 1:48:00 AM] Mom: If he is gg to be visiting sgp once in every 6 months, u can take up school's recommendation & complement it with an annual travel ins policy, should you feel the plan provided by school is inadequate.
[26/9/19, 1:53:22 AM] Mom: In general, USD 500,000 annual limit looks quite enough.
However, I hv seen cases whereby a 3 weeks’ hospital stay in the USA (treatment for pneumonia) cost as much USD500,000.00.
Suggest tt u get school or service provider to give you an indication of average hospitalisation cost over there

[18/10/19, 12:47:58 AM] Mom: Den we won’t be going Europe tog w all of u? But u mentioned u got enough miles.  So how does it works if I want to go Europe?
[18/10/19, 12:48:24 AM] Sinclair: Worse case u and dad economy
[18/10/19, 12:48:26 AM] Sinclair: Will still go
[18/10/19, 12:48:32 AM] Sinclair: But I doubt so
[18/10/19, 12:48:40 AM] Sinclair: Sherwin and me will use miles to redeem business
[18/10/19, 12:48:45 AM] Mom: Our Osaka not cancel yet rite?
[18/10/19, 12:48:47 AM] Sinclair: But not all the way to London
[18/10/19, 12:48:50 AM] Sinclair: Somewhere nearby
[18/10/19, 12:49:04 AM] Sinclair: Osaka is u settle one mah
[18/10/19, 12:49:08 AM] Sinclair: U say u call right
[18/10/19, 12:49:19 AM] Sinclair: U must work out w Sidney first before u call again
[18/10/19, 12:49:19 AM] Mom: I have not do anything yet?
[18/10/19, 12:49:25 AM] Sinclair: Have u?
[18/10/19, 12:49:28 AM] Sinclair: I don’t think u called yet right
[18/10/19, 12:49:36 AM] Mom: Not yet
[18/10/19, 12:50:03 AM] Sinclair: Ok so basically for Europe
[18/10/19, 12:50:13 AM] Sinclair: U and dad will join us for sure (even if pay economy)
[18/10/19, 12:50:23 AM] Sinclair: But we will do our best to find business flights
[18/10/19, 12:50:30 AM] Sinclair: Which I think is highly possible
[18/10/19, 12:50:43 AM] Sinclair: But like if u want confirmed business
[18/10/19, 12:50:48 AM] Sinclair: Then it’ll be Sidney book that flight
[18/10/19, 12:50:54 AM] Sinclair: But then again it’s quite mafan for u
[18/10/19, 12:50:59 AM] Sinclair: Cause u from London must go helsinki
[18/10/19, 12:51:02 AM] Sinclair: Transit Narita
[18/10/19, 12:51:07 AM] Sinclair: Then Singapore
[18/10/19, 12:51:11 AM] Sinclair: So u transit 2 times
[18/10/19, 12:51:21 AM] Sinclair: And need to use miles for the last leg somemore
[18/10/19, 12:51:50 AM] Sinclair: Which is why we won’t be able to go Jan trip
[18/10/19, 12:54:41 AM] Mom: Sorry really confusing.  Can u help me to work out.  I still want to spend time w u to go Osaka.  For Europe Dad n me can fly Econ no prob.  U c what is the best way to work this out.  If Sid got prob understanding my “wish” Copy n paste this to him.
[18/10/19, 12:56:07 AM] Sinclair: I think he sleep aldy
[18/10/19, 12:56:15 AM] Mom: Ya
[18/10/19, 12:56:27 AM] Mom: When he wakes up still less than 24 hrs.
[18/10/19, 12:56:43 AM] Sinclair: I initially already told him that dad and mum wants to go japan in jan
[18/10/19, 12:56:45 AM] Mom: So if need to cancel hope is FREE
[18/10/19, 12:56:51 AM] Sinclair: But he very insistent on booking I don’t know why
[18/10/19, 12:57:10 AM] Sinclair: You try to catch him tomorrow lor
[18/10/19, 12:57:14 AM] Sinclair: I should be waking up later than u
[18/10/19, 12:59:13 AM] Mom: oh when he said u said I confirmed want to go Japan I told him not true Cos at that point of time I thinking Cos of the miles we can forgo Japan n go Europe.
[18/10/19, 12:59:36 AM] Mom: Den he asked me to talk n confirm w u n before I can talk to u he alr book.
[18/10/19, 1:01:10 AM] Mom: So what should I tell him? Asked him to cancel the Helsinki-Tokyo for me n dad?
[18/10/19, 1:01:11 AM] Sinclair: Cause the problem is if u use 2/6 flights
[18/10/19, 1:01:16 AM] Sinclair: Then the other 4 very difficult to use
[18/10/19, 1:01:26 AM] Sinclair: Unless u and dad want to go japan alone both of u all
[18/10/19, 1:01:30 AM] Sinclair: Then I am ok
[18/10/19, 1:01:34 AM] Sinclair: At least it’s used properly
[18/10/19, 1:01:40 AM] Sinclair: I don’t want to have tickets dangling
[18/10/19, 1:01:52 AM] Mom: No don’t want only 2 of US.  Want to be w U.
[18/10/19, 1:01:52 AM] Sinclair: Then jan maybe we can go taiwan or something
[18/10/19, 1:02:01 AM] Sinclair: Instead of japan
[18/10/19, 1:02:24 AM] Sinclair: If all 3 wants to go then u use the ticket then I need to find one more round trip which is difficult and waste miles
[18/10/19, 1:02:37 AM] Mom: Meaning u need to use miles to go w us?
[18/10/19, 1:02:42 AM] Sinclair: Ya lor

2.) in Kyoto I don’t know do they have a pass include free attractions entrance.  But so far I check don’t seem to have. So if don’t have maybe we can but the Hankyu Tourist pass 2 days S$15
[23/12/19, 7:12:51 PM] Mom: If u pass by tourist Centre just check ☝

[20/1/20, 4:34:59 AM] Sinclair: Thanks
[22/1/20, 6:41:38 AM] Mom: Dear Parents/ Guardian of Caz Leung,

I am Ms Huan, form teacher of class 2E2.

I understand from Caz that she will be travelling back to Hong Kong on coming Friday, 24 Jan 2020 and hence she will be missing school on Friday.

I have checked in with my school Year Head. Caz will need a parent's or guardian's letter for her absenteeism on Friday.

Just to keep you informed regarding our school attendance policy, the school does not encourage students to miss lessons during term time as we believe in the importance of being in school daily for effective learning. Hence, students must exercise responsibility and work closely with a buddy to be on task with what they might have missed. The student must also take initiative to consult subject teachers to clarify doubts he/she may have. For such cases, student's absenteeism will be considered 'absence without valid reason' and will be given zero marks if there are to be any quizzes or tests conducted during his/her period of absence.

In this case, Caz's absenteeism will be marked as 'absence without valid reason'. But fortunately, there will not be lessons conducted on the day. However, she is encouraged in future to book a later flight in the afternoon to avoid absenteeism.

I thank you for working closely with the school to ensure that your child aspires and achieves her best.

I wish you a Happy Chinese New Year! 😊
[22/1/20, 9:24:33 AM] Mom: Nice !!!

[29/1/20, 12:56:43 AM] Mom: As far as I can remember I complained 2 things.  One is they refused to let me send them to AP but rather prefer to have lunch w her sis.  But ytd sort out w shel n shel said no pre planned.  So issue cleared
[29/1/20, 12:57:59 AM] Mom: 2nd thing is that she don’t know how to ask shel to come back more often.   N never attend small ah Ee dinner but instead accompany her mum shopping.  This issue also alr sort out w shel.  Case closed
[29/1/20, 12:59:12 AM] Sinclair: so ok what
[29/1/20, 12:59:18 AM] Sinclair: u ownself say one
[29/1/20, 12:59:30 AM] Sinclair: i think u should find one day and talk to sindy personally
[29/1/20, 12:59:35 AM] Sinclair: sometimes she can be insecure
[29/1/20, 12:59:38 AM] Sinclair: good to assure her
[29/1/20, 12:59:54 AM] Sinclair: and she puts alot of effort too
[29/1/20, 1:00:03 AM] Mom: Since when I said I don’t like her Cos of her bro.
[29/1/20, 1:00:31 AM] Sinclair: as in u just told me so i am asking u is it true
[29/1/20, 1:01:01 AM] Mom: Hum?
[29/1/20, 1:01:47 AM] Sinclair: I’m asking you is this true lah
[29/1/20, 1:01:54 AM] Sinclair: Why you so confused
[29/1/20, 1:02:05 AM] Mom: of course not true lah
[29/1/20, 1:02:21 AM] Mom: She n her bro n her parents are totally different
[29/1/20, 1:03:23 AM] Sinclair: But you cannot tell her that
[29/1/20, 1:03:26 AM] Mom: Dad n me never once blamed her or dislike her Cos of this issue.   I never even put her as a family member of them.  She is now a family member of ours
[29/1/20, 1:04:31 AM] Mom: Why not?  She should not blame herself Cos she is family w them?
[29/1/20, 1:04:50 AM] Mom: All boil down to shel greed
[29/1/20, 1:05:44 AM] Sinclair: But she still is their family what
[29/1/20, 1:05:51 AM] Sinclair: At the end of the day
[29/1/20, 1:06:03 AM] Sinclair: You cannot expect her to don’t like her family
[29/1/20, 1:06:11 AM] Sinclair: Ya lor that one is his own fault no choice
[29/1/20, 1:06:17 AM] Sinclair: But he also stressed now lah
[29/1/20, 1:06:26 AM] Sinclair: Don’t too pressure him later he 想不开
[29/1/20, 1:08:02 AM] Mom: Yes still her family but why they treated her n shel this way???? Pay others n lessen others burden n not their own daughter n Son in law burden.  Not that shel or we r very rich.  Her daughter n son in law need to work till wee hours in order to earn n return to friends. This part I cannot accept it
[29/1/20, 1:08:55 AM] Mom: I know her mum don’t really like her compare to her bro n sis.
[29/1/20, 1:09:16 AM] Mom: N her mum also don’t like shel when they park Tor time
[29/1/20, 1:21:09 AM] Sinclair: Maybe lor
[29/1/20, 1:21:29 AM] Sinclair: But maybe u should talk to Sindy
[29/1/20, 1:21:40 AM] Sinclair: To clear the misunderstanding that u dun like her
[29/1/20, 1:22:01 AM] Mom: Aiyo if I talked to her both of us sure cry !!

[22/2/22, 6:50:42 AM] Sinclair: Anyway ur flight looks like not VTL
[22/2/22, 6:50:59 AM] Sinclair: https://mainlymiles.com/2022/02/22/your-vtl-flight-options-with-qatar-airways-etihad-and-emirates/

[22/2/22, 7:00:10 AM] Sinclair: Infiniti how?
‎[22/2/22, 7:00:11 AM] Mom: ‎image omitted
[22/2/22, 7:00:19 AM] Sinclair: This is first class
[22/2/22, 7:00:31 AM] Mom: I know.  But same plane?
[22/2/22, 7:00:37 AM] Mom: Sell
[22/2/22, 7:00:56 AM] Sinclair: Siao
[22/2/22, 7:00:59 AM] Sinclair: Not for that lousy car
[22/2/22, 7:01:03 AM] Sinclair: If sell also change to Hyundai
[22/2/22, 7:01:12 AM] Sinclair: I think so
[22/2/22, 7:01:58 AM] Mom: https://m.sgcarmart.com/used_cars/info.php?ID=1037437
[22/2/22, 7:04:24 AM] Sinclair: I thought that time u already say Infiniti same price
[22/2/22, 7:04:29 AM] Sinclair: Then just leave it stop changing
[22/2/22, 7:04:33 AM] Sinclair: Diesel engine is better anyway
[22/2/22, 7:05:50 AM] Mom: This one convert to normal plate.  $1.7k/year addition.  So after convention $43k.  
When scrape still got $3.5k body value + scrape value $6.8K = $10.3
So $43k (buying price) - $10.3k = $32.7 / 47 months = Dep $8.3k/year.
[22/2/22, 7:06:35 AM] Mom: Lately one Q30 same year as us compressor spoilt.  Spare part need 2 months to indent!!
[22/2/22, 7:15:19 AM] Sinclair: Then abit stupid right same price as Infiniti
[22/2/22, 7:15:36 AM] Sinclair: Then u never go and find out 2016 Hyundai in Singapore compressor got spoil or not?
[22/2/22, 7:17:11 AM] Mom: The consider for Infiniti is cos the spare part VERY XXX.  The only drawback.
[22/2/22, 7:23:27 AM] Sinclair: 16 year old can do grab?
[22/2/22, 7:27:49 AM] Mom: Grab cannot.  Gojek can
[22/2/22, 7:29:07 AM] Sinclair: So you paying more for a much older car and lousier brand and cannot do grab?
[22/2/22, 7:30:04 AM] Mom: Aiya he just go n c n not confirm will buy lah.  Let him shiok since it has been his dream car.
[22/2/22, 7:32:58 AM] Sinclair: Ok
‎[22/2/22, 10:19:06 AM] Sinclair: ‎image omitted
[22/2/22, 10:19:08 AM] Sinclair: We should buy
‎[23/2/22, 12:14:59 AM] Mom: ‎image omitted
[23/2/22, 12:15:08 AM] Mom: We have a choice of changing our flight to 19/3 - 1/4.  Reason cos now our rtn flight is not a VTL flight so must SHN 7 days.  If change no need SHN.  N all our hotel n trains booking won’t be affected much.
[23/2/22, 12:15:18 AM] Mom: Changing of flight is a VTL flight on 1/4 so no need SHN.
[23/2/22, 12:15:19 AM] Mom: The amt to top up $254 for 2 pax but can go down their office might be less than this amt.
[23/2/22, 12:15:31 AM] Mom: What u think?
[23/2/22, 12:21:29 AM] Sinclair: Why will it be less?
[23/2/22, 12:23:12 AM] Mom: thru cecilia experience the last time changing from Italy to Sw which cost at least $1,000 but when she went down only cost $15 each
[23/2/22, 12:23:46 AM] Mom: anw she going down later and has asked her to double check
[23/2/22, 12:24:11 AM] Mom: $1,000 online change
[23/2/22, 12:31:32 AM] Sinclair: But your change fee now is $0 as shown in ur image
[23/2/22, 12:32:13 AM] Mom: $254 is fare different which is the same as Cecilia before
[23/2/22, 12:33:08 AM] Mom: anw putting this aside u think i should change to avoid the SHN?
[23/2/22, 12:33:15 AM] Sinclair: Aiya don’t talk about Cecilia I don’t know what fare she book it might be different from yours
[23/2/22, 12:33:18 AM] Sinclair: Cannot compare
[23/2/22, 12:33:27 AM] Sinclair: If it is $254 can consider
[23/2/22, 12:33:31 AM] Sinclair: It’s for u and dad to decide
[23/2/22, 12:33:44 AM] Sinclair: Whether you both want to stay at home for 1 wk
[23/2/22, 12:33:52 AM] Sinclair: And if dad need go back office
[23/2/22, 12:34:04 AM] Sinclair: If it makes his boss happier then of course pay the $254
[23/2/22, 12:34:22 AM] Sinclair: But if he is going to stay at home anyway then u need to see if u want to pay $254 to go out earlier lor
[23/2/22, 12:34:49 AM] Sinclair: Also your VTL is 9.5 hours transit as compared to your current 3 hours I think
[23/2/22, 12:34:57 AM] Mom: the only thing is that the rtn transit is 9 hrs compare to now only 1.5 hr
[23/2/22, 12:34:58 AM] Sinclair: So can consider that also
[23/2/22, 12:35:08 AM] Sinclair: Ya that’s what I’m saying
[23/2/22, 12:35:15 AM] Sinclair: You and dad will be very tired
[23/2/22, 12:35:56 AM] Mom: aunty saying u going out dinner tonight
[23/2/22, 12:36:24 AM] Sinclair: Eh? But if you SHN at the end still must pcr?
[23/2/22, 12:36:32 AM] Sinclair: Then $100 X 2
[23/2/22, 12:36:38 AM] Sinclair: Then VTL more worth it right
[23/2/22, 12:37:21 AM] Mom: not only that cos till date dad still have not confirmed with his boss SHN no need leave!!!
[23/2/22, 12:37:44 AM] Sinclair: No need leave what?
[23/2/22, 12:37:48 AM] Sinclair: I’m not going tonight already
[23/2/22, 12:37:58 AM] Mom: haha he just replied ok with a 👍
[23/2/22, 12:38:25 AM] Mom: by company regualtion must be your own leave to cover SHN
[23/2/22, 12:40:31 AM] Sinclair: As in even if u choose SHN you also need to pay for 2 pcr test which is about $200
[23/2/22, 12:40:41 AM] Sinclair: But for VTL you no need PCR
[23/2/22, 12:40:45 AM] Sinclair: So the difference is $0
[23/2/22, 12:40:50 AM] Sinclair: So change to VTL is better?
[23/2/22, 12:40:59 AM] Sinclair: Because you don’t save money anyway
[23/2/22, 1:12:25 AM] Mom: alr change with ZERO top up!!!!
[23/2/22, 1:16:27 AM] Sinclair: 👍👍

Good morning,
Re: Policy H220226208
Based on our discussion, Sinclair requested to have the insurer review & remove the exclusion to all hospitalisation, treatment &/or surgery arising out of, and/or in relation to any disease of the testicle & its complications.
In order for the insurer to review, they will need the latest medical report (if any) or a letter of discharge showing/stating that he has recovered & there is no follow-up or medication required for the condition.
With reference to; Form A – Application & consent for release of medical information, all the options do not reflect his intention. The closest, will be to select “others” & specify that you want to request for a letter of discharge.
I hope the above address your concerns.

[19/2/24, 4:52:59 PM] Mom: He going Batam
[19/2/24, 4:53:49 PM] Sinclair: Dear Sir/Madam,

I am writing to express my profound dissatisfaction with the substandard service I received from Citibank's limousine service, which was booked for my recent airport transfers. This letter outlines two separate incidents that not only caused significant inconvenience but also demonstrated a lack of professionalism and customer care that I did not expect from a reputable institution like Citibank.

Incident on Departure:
I had scheduled a pick-up for 7:30 AM (please verify the exact time from your records), but due to an unforeseen flight delay of 2 hours, the service was no longer required at the scheduled time. Despite this common scenario, the driver arrived at the predetermined time without verifying the flight's status, which could have easily been checked to prevent any inconvenience. Upon informing the driver of the cancellation due to the delay, I was taken aback to learn about a $10 cancellation fee imposed by your service. It is unreasonable to penalize customers for circumstances beyond their control, especially when due diligence on the part of the service provider could have averted the situation.

Incident on Arrival:
The return flight was delayed, changing the arrival time from 2340 hrs to 0225 hrs. Despite informing your team of the delay, the coordination and communication were grossly mishandled. A driver messaged to announce his arrival without checking the updated flight details. When my secretary called to rectify the situation, she was met with unprofessionalism and rudeness by a staff member named Ali. His refusal to acknowledge the absence of an SMS notification regarding the limousine details, insistence on mistrusting my secretary's words, and his overall demeanor were far from the standard of service expected from Citibank. Furthermore, the eventual resolution was delayed and incomplete, lacking crucial details previously provided like the car's license plate number.

Such experiences not only caused unnecessary stress and inconvenience but also reflected poorly on Citibank's commitment to customer service excellence. It is distressing that the basic principles of service, such as verifying flight details for airport pickups and transparent communication, were overlooked. Moreover, the confrontational attitude of your staff member, Ali, exacerbated the situation, making it even more unpleasant.

I urge you to address these issues promptly. I expect a thorough investigation into these incidents, a formal apology for the inconvenience caused, and a waiver of the unjust cancellation fee. Moreover, I would appreciate a response from a manager regarding the steps Citibank will take to prevent such occurrences in the future and to ensure that all staff members are adequately trained in customer service etiquette.

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to your prompt response.
[19/2/24, 4:54:03 PM] Sinclair: No need, I write already
[19/2/24, 4:54:11 PM] Sinclair: Just read make sure it’s correct factually then send
[19/2/24, 6:24:14 PM] Mom: ChatGPA?
[19/2/24, 6:30:35 PM] Sinclair: Yup I just copy and paste what u send me haha
[19/2/24, 6:33:08 PM] Mom: These r missing!!! 
Need to add in Ali refused to give his name initially n also bug back what is the issue that must give his name. 

Also the whole issue took from 0016 hr to 0126 hr total of 1 hr 10 mins to final settled.  

Finally no child seat for the airport pick up as requested and already charged
[19/2/24, 6:34:53 PM] Sinclair: Dear Sir/Madam,

I am writing to express my deep dissatisfaction with the poor standard of service provided by Citibank's limousine service, which was booked for airport transfers. The series of events that unfolded not only caused inconvenience but also highlighted a serious lack of professionalism and customer care.

Incident on Departure:
The limousine was scheduled for a 7:30 AM pickup. However, due to an unexpected flight delay of 2 hours, the service was no longer required at the original time. Despite this, the driver arrived without verifying the flight's updated schedule, a basic precaution that should have been taken. When I informed the driver of the cancellation, I was informed about a $10 cancellation fee, which seems unfair under the circumstances, especially since the delay was easily verifiable.

Incident on Arrival:
My return flight was delayed, changing my expected arrival from 2340 hrs to 0225 hrs. Despite this, I received a message from the driver at 0016 hrs stating he was on site. When my secretary called to address the delay, she encountered significant unprofessionalism from a staff member named Ali. Not only did Ali refuse to acknowledge the lack of communication (no SMS regarding the limousine details was received), but he also initially refused to provide his name, questioning why it was necessary. This behavior is unacceptable and not indicative of the service standards expected from Citibank.

The situation from start to finish, from 0016 hrs to 0126 hrs, took an hour and ten minutes to resolve, during which no satisfactory solution was provided promptly. Furthermore, the limousine provided for the airport pickup did not include a child seat as requested and for which I was already charged, adding to the inconvenience and distress caused by this entire experience.

The lack of basic service elements such as verifying flight details for airport pickups, the absence of essential amenities like a child seat, and the poor communication and customer service, particularly from Ali, are alarming. It reflects poorly on Citibank's commitment to customer satisfaction and service excellence.

I request a full investigation into these incidents, an apology for the inconvenience and distress caused, a refund of the unjust cancellation fee, and a refund for the unprovided child seat. Additionally, I insist on a response from a manager regarding how Citibank intends to prevent such failures in the future and ensure all staff members are trained to treat customers with the respect and professionalism they deserve.

Thank you for your immediate attention to this matter. I look forward to your prompt and satisfactory resolution.

[13/10/24, 7:30:57 PM] Sinclair: Alamak

[13/10/24, 7:31:12 PM] Mom: Stupid eyes doc said laboratory results showed the eyes antibiotics “rejected” by the bacteria so need a higher dose .  But after another higher doc checked just said continue a the drop for 2 weeks.
[13/10/24, 7:31:46 PM] Sinclair: But u never ask the higher doc why the first doc say is rejected?
[13/10/24, 7:31:49 PM] Mom: But clinically the antibiotics worked on dad cos 97% recovered
[13/10/24, 7:32:05 PM] Mom: N they checked his eyes everything ok
[13/10/24, 7:32:42 PM] Mom: At that time never ask! 🤦‍♀️
[13/10/24, 7:33:27 PM] Mom: Den I asked for another swap of the eyes cos fr start the bacteria was detected in the eye swap.  All other blood test no tract of bacteria in body.
[13/10/24, 7:34:22 PM] Mom: But the stupid doc said they don’t do another swap.  If swap came back w bacteria den what to do next.  I was so shocked w his reply n don’t know how to react.
[13/10/24, 7:34:42 PM] Mom: He explained that since dad eyes so well should be no more bacteria
[13/10/24, 7:35:39 PM] Sinclair: Maybe should just trust the higher doc and let him handle
[13/10/24, 7:35:47 PM] Sinclair: Don’t care what the new doctor say
[13/10/24, 7:37:22 PM] Mom: After that they sent him back to his room n the infectious team came so I told the docs of what n requested they to speak to the eye doc again.  Cannot accept no confirmation that the bacteria is no longer there.
[13/10/24, 7:38:35 PM] Mom: Now eye doc called dad n said he will asked the infectious doc to do the swap.

[19/5/25, 9:39:23 AM] Mom: His jaundice shot up to 314… doctor said no negotiation, need to admit into hospital cos the passing mark is 340. So today he will be admitted into hospital then tmrw see if the figures drop

Suspect either his body functions cannot process the bilirubin causing the jaundice… or the content in my breast milk cos he has been drinking only breast milk. 

Doc wna rule out the possibility of my breast milk, cos he also suspect it’s the Chinese herbs in my confinement soup.. so I will stop my soups for now

[23/10/25, 12:22:12 AM] Sinclair: Toilet
[23/10/25, 1:04:13 AM] Mom: Hi Sherman,

Thank you for your message. An official tape marked “open for inspection by customs” by no means constitutes official confirmation of a U.S. Customs rejection of the package. What you stated about it being a false customs declaration is your own opinion and not something from U.S. Customs — if there were a rejection, there would be documentation (and this has been confirmed by JustShip’s Myla as well as a FedEx individual). Therefore, the accusation that it is a false customs declaration is not justified.

Again, JustShip has represented that it is indeed my right to come down to collect the parcel and that JustShip has no reason to hold it hostage — this is verbatim, directly from JustShip. Upon reaching JustShip’s office, the package was held hostage until I was instructed to pay for its release. So, claiming otherwise is simply contradictory.

Lastly, there was no communication indicating my agreement for the package to be shipped back from the U.S. to Singapore. This was initiated by FedEx or JustShip, and if there was no agreement from me on the amount of the return charge, why was this processed?

With the above:
	1.	Please provide confirmation of any FedEx charge for the return (if any).
	2.	There has been poor customer experience from JustShip, providing contradictory statements about the shipment from day one up until today — even your message is not aligned with what was previously communicated to me. With that, I believe a fair settlement amount is SGD 75, since JustShip should also take responsibility for allowing the return to Singapore without prior agreement.
	3.	If not agreeable with (2), I request that the package be released to me within the next 24 hours, failing which I will report this case to the police for theft and also report JustShip to CASE for violating customer rights.

Thank you for your attention, and I look forward to hearing from you.

[28/10/25, 5:04:49 AM] Mom: Now can go sleep soundly
[28/10/25, 5:05:12 AM] Mom: Thank you for your message. An official tape marked “open for inspection by customs” by no means constitutes official confirmation of a U.S. Customs rejection of the package. What you stated about it being a false customs declaration is your own opinion and not something from U.S. Customs — if there were a rejection, there would be documentation (and this has been confirmed by JustShip’s Myla as well as a FedEx individual). Therefore, the accusation that it is a false customs declaration is not justified.

Additionally, it is unacceptable that JustShip opened my package after it has been sealed by customs. I will pursue this action as retaliation and a means to coerce me to make payment by holding my belongings hostage. 

Again, JustShip has represented that it is indeed my right to come down to collect the parcel and that JustShip has no reason to hold it hostage — this is verbatim, directly from JustShip. Upon reaching JustShip’s office, the package was held hostage until I was instructed to pay for its release. So, claiming otherwise is simply contradictory.

Lastly, there was no communication indicating my agreement for the package to be shipped back from the U.S. to Singapore. This was initiated by FedEx or JustShip, and if there was no agreement from me on the amount of the return charge, why was this processed?
[28/10/25, 5:05:12 AM] Mom: With the above:
	1.	Noting that there has been poor customer experience from JustShip, providing contradictory statements about the shipment (pick up on 13 Aug) from day one up until today — even your message is not aligned with what was previously communicated to me. With that, I believe a fair settlement amount is SGD 75, since JustShip should also take responsibility for allowing the return to Singapore without prior agreement, and for opening my package without my permission. If agreed, I will make the payment by PayNow immediately and collect personally on Friday.
	2. If not agreeable with (1), I request that the package be released to me within the next 24 hours, failing which I will report this case to the police for theft and also report JustShip to CASE for violating customer rights.

Thank you for your attention, and I look forward to hearing from you by tomorrow.
[28/10/25, 5:05:13 AM] Mom: *Charlotte:* 

Suzanna, your parcel was rejected by U.S. Customs and returned to Singapore, sealed with official “Opened for Inspection by U.S. Customs and Border Protection” tape.

The shipment was falsely declared as “1 × soft toy personal gift (S$300)” when it in fact contained approximately 30 boxed collectibles valued above S$900.

This constitutes a false declaration, for which the shipper bears full responsibility under JustShip’s Terms of Use, which you agreed to upon creating the shipment.

JustShip and its authorised agents are expressly permitted to open and inspect shipments at any time.

FedEx has billed S$150.15 for the return freight. In accordance with our Terms, the parcel will not be released until this amount is paid in full via PayNow to UEN 202027054G (JustShip Pte Ltd).

Failure to make payment will result in disposal or donation of the parcel.

This serves as JustShip’s final notice. There will be no negotiation and no further correspondence.

[30/10/25, 8:14:38 PM] Mom: 1️⃣ CASE Online Complaint Draft

I wish to file a complaint against JustShip (Singapore) for illegally opening my U.S. CBP-sealed parcel without my permission and threatening to dispose or donate my package unless I paid S$150.

My parcel, shipped via JustShip/FedEx on 13 August 2025 to New York, was later returned. On 28 October 2025, JustShip admitted via WhatsApp that they had opened the CBP-sealed box, claiming they were “expressly permitted” to do so.

FedEx confirmed that only U.S. Customs officers may legally open CBP-sealed parcels.

I was not informed of the return date, and no return fee was highlighted prior to their demand. I never agreed to any return fee. I paid S$150 under protest solely to recover my parcel.

I request CASE to investigate this illegal act and coercion and help secure a full refund of S$150.

Supporting evidence: WhatsApp messages, FedEx confirmation, emails, and payment receipt.
